Is your solution fully working or not? 
In conclusion, driver prints out everything in sort by HashCode after population method executed, so I consider it as fully working.

For the classes in person package, the default constructor given by Sheila only asks for certain variables. Therefore, I need to implement setter methods and execute the rest in RegistrationSystem.java in order to not conflicting the principle. Including the basic getter and setter methods for most variables in each class, I also initialize an ArrayList and implement relevant methods to input and output the prerequisite for each course.  

Justify any additional classes you included in your solution.
I created a new Person class as super class of Student and Faculty for duplicate methods.

Did you work on the extra credit problem? Briefly describe any issues or explain any assumptions made.
Yes. I was thinking I would initialize a list for the person classes have if I were making a real reg system, so I can find out a person's classes/sections, but what will the new relationship be if I do so?

How much time did you spend on the assignment?
I spent approximate 8 hours on computer.

Any feedback on the assignment?
Some of the methods and variables are not used for current populate methods, yet I keep them because the provided Javadoc mentioned.
